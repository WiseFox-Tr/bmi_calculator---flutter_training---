# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª
## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how to customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. 

## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
